# OutOfOrderBot
coding challenge


added as a coding challenge for anyone who is interested in understanding the order of cookie and token exchange for a site with switching protocols that hand server ips through their api as well as multiple unique cookies which must be obtained and used in the correct order.


each 302 post, 200 get, or headers response is saved to its own file. if you arent getting all the files then it wont be able to continue the chain of GET requests.
